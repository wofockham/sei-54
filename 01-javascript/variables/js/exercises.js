// # Exercises: Variables

// ## The Fortune Teller

// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

// - Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
// - Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

const children = 4;
const partnerName = 'Gwenda';
const geolocation = 'Samoa';
const jobTitle = 'undertaker';

// Traditional JS:
// const fortune = 'You will be a ' + jobTitle + ' in ' + geolocation + ', and married to ' + partnerName + ' with ' + children + ' kids.';

// ES6 aka ES2015
// Interpolation
const fortune = `You will be a ${ jobTitle } in ${ geolocation }, and married to ${ partnerName } with ${ children } kids.`;
console.log(fortune);

// ## The Age Calculator

// Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it!

// - Store the current year in a variable.
// - Store their birth year in a variable.
// - Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.
// - Output them to the screen like so: "They are either NN or NN", substituting the values.

const currentYear = 2022;
const birthYear = 1987;

const ageBeforeBirthday = currentYear - birthYear;
const ageAfterBirthday = ageBeforeBirthday + 1;

console.log(`They are either ${ ageBeforeBirthday } or ${ ageAfterBirthday }`);

// ## The Lifetime Supply Calculator

// Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

// - Store your current age into a variable.
// - Store a maximum age into a variable.
// - Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
// - Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
// - Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".

const age = 36;
const deathAge = 99;
const amountPerDay = 11; // hotdogs

const amountPerYear = amountPerDay * 365.25; // leap years
const yearsRemaining = deathAge - age;

const amountRequired = yearsRemaining * amountPerYear;
console.log(`You will need ${ amountRequired } to last you until the ripe old age of ${ deathAge }`);

// ## The Geometrizer

// Calculate properties of a circle, using [the definitions here](http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.htm).

// - Store a radius into a variable.
// - Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
// - Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

const radius = 1;
const circumference = 2 * radius * Math.PI; // diameter * pi
console.log(`The circumference is ${ circumference }`);
const area = Math.PI * radius * radius; // pi * radius^2
console.log(`The area is ${ area }`);

// ## The Temperature Converter

// It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on [the steps here](http://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html).

// - Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// - Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".
// - Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
// - Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."

const currentTemperature = 20; // celsius
const fahrenheit = currentTemperature * 1.8 + 32;
console.log(`${ currentTemperature }°C is ${ fahrenheit }°F`);

const celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8; // precedence
console.log(`${ fahrenheit }°F is ${ celsius }°C.`);
